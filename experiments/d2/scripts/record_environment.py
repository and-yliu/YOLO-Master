"""Record the identity of a D2 experiment run: code version, dependencies, teacher weights, config hashes.

``metrics.csv`` says what a run produced and ``args.yaml`` says what it was asked to do, but neither says which
code produced it. Three weeks later that gap is unrecoverable: the commit has moved, the environment has been
reinstalled, and there is no way to tell whether an uncommitted edit was in the working tree at the time.

This writes that identity to JSON so a run can be audited later without relying on anyone's memory.

Two deliberate choices:

- **Dirty state is reported honestly, and twice.** A repository-wide ``dirty`` flag is usually true during active
  work (generated results, scratch files), which makes it useless on its own. A second flag covers only the paths
  that define the experiment, so a reviewer can tell "there were stray files" apart from "the experiment inputs
  were modified".
- **The teacher revision is read from the Hugging Face cache, not from config.** The cache stores snapshots under
  ``snapshots/<commit-sha>/``, so this records the revision that was actually loaded rather than one someone typed
  into a document. See ``limitations.md`` 2.3.

No token, password, or full environment dump is ever written; see ``limitations.md`` 4.
